# AOS

AOS is a research prototype for an agent operating system built around deterministic runtime semantics, artifact-based collaboration, and replaceable inference backends.

The codebase is intentionally exploratory, but the core runtime is implemented and covered by Go tests. The current repo includes a file-backed kernel, IPC bus, artifact store, lease manager, capability model, tool runtime, workflow engine, configurable local LLM integration, and an interactive terminal UI.

## Current Status

- Research prototype, not a polished product release
- Core Go packages test cleanly with the repo-local cache path used by `make test`
- Active areas include workflow tooling, skills, local TUI ergonomics, and evaluation/demo workflows
- Generated live-run artifacts are treated as disposable outputs, not durable source assets

See [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) for the current project snapshot and [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for repo hygiene before sharing milestones.

## Repository Layout

- `cmd/` entrypoints for the CLI, TUI, smoke tests, demos, and mini-project runners
- `internal/` runtime, kernel, workflow, inference, tool, and TUI implementation packages
- `skills/` local skill definitions used by workflow or interactive sessions
- `workflows/` JSON workflow specs for multi-agent experiments and demos
- `reports/` curated milestone reports and a small set of durable reference outputs

## Common Commands

- `make test`
- `make fmt`
- `go run ./cmd/aos`
- `go run ./cmd/aos-tui --workdir .`

## Workflows in the TUI

`go run ./cmd/aos-tui --workflow workflow.json --workdir DIR` runs the workflow's entry agent interactively. When it delegates, the delegated agents run through the same engine as `aos run --workflow`, and the TUI shows their progress:

- each delegated agent's activity is printed in the transcript, indented by depth between `┌ agent` and `└ agent exited` markers
- a pinned progress row shows the delegation stack (`coordinator 3/400 › writer 49/200`), how long the current agent has been running, what it is doing, and how many delegations have finished

Press Esc while a task is running to cancel it. Cancelling stops the model call, kills any running `run` command, closes delegated agents, and checkpoints the conversation. Your next message continues from there, and the agent is told its previous task was interrupted.

`--agent ID` starts from a different agent in the workflow. Context compaction follows `AOS_LLM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` and `AOS_COMPACT_RATIO`, the same way it does for `aos run`.

`make test` uses repo-local `GOCACHE` and `GOTMPDIR` paths so tests run reliably in sandboxed environments too.

## Verification Policy

Verification is a workflow choice, not a built-in step. `aos run` without `--workflow` takes `--verify none|required|best_effort` (default `none`):

- `none` writes the assembled output without a verifier call
- `required` writes the output only after the verifier approves it
- `best_effort` runs the verifier and records its verdict, but keeps the output either way

The contract harness in `internal/workflow` uses the same policies: `Engine.Verifier` is optional, and `Engine.Verification` defaults to `required` when a verifier is set and `none` otherwise.

## LLM Backend Config

AOS now uses backend-agnostic env vars for live model selection:

- `AOS_LLM_BACKEND` with values such as `vllm`, `ollama`, or `openai-compatible`
- `AOS_LLM_BASE_URL`
- `AOS_LLM_MODEL`
- `AOS_LLM_API_KEY`
- `AOS_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `AOS_LLM_TEMPERATURE` (default `0`), `AOS_LLM_TOP_P`, `AOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` optional sampling controls; thinking models such as Qwen should not run greedy, e.g. temperature `0.6` with top_p `0.95`
- `AOS_LLM_THINKING_BUDGET` optional cap on reasoning tokens, sent as `reasoning_budget_tokens` for llama.cpp-style servers such as Strata
- `AOS_LLM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` model context size in tokens; when set, workflow runs compact agent history at `AOS_COMPACT_RATIO` (default `0.8`) of it instead of the small built-in limits

Legacy `AOS_VLLM_*` vars are still supported as fallback for existing scripts.

Example using Ollama:

```sh
AOS_LLM_BACKEND=ollama \
AOS_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 \
AOS_LLM_MODEL=qwen3.6:35b-a3b-mtp-q4_K_M \
go run ./cmd/aos run --workflow ./workflows/rasterizer-optimized-tail.json --output ./reports/rasterizer-team-demo/final-summary.txt
```
